# 🔐 File Integrity Checker – Python Script

This repository provides a lightweight, standalone **File Integrity Checker** written in Python. It helps verify the authenticity and consistency of files in a directory by generating and validating cryptographic checksums.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Verify Integrity**: Checks each file against the manifest to detect modifications, deletions, or unexpected additions.
- 📁 **Recursive Directory Support**: Automatically scans subdirectories.
- 🔄 **Customizable Hash Algorithm**: Choose from `sha256`, `md5`, `sha1`, and more.
- 🧊 **Pure Python**: No third-party dependencies required.
